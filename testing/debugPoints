Issue:	ESP not getting connected.
debug:	The 'state' variable which controls the CH_PD pin of the ESP was initialized to LOW.
	Thus the CH_PD was not enabling the ESP-01 module
	Thus either the if-decision loop should have a (~state) which would turn CH_PD high.
	The CH_PD should be initialized to 'HIGH'
Code:
	state = HIGH;

	OR

	if(~state){
		digitalWrite(A2,HIGH); //CH_PD pin, enable ESP
	}
	else{
		digitalWrite(A2,LOW); //CH_PD pin, disable ESP 
	}

Issue:	ATmega328 not accepting code. No programming possible.
	If programming is successful, there is a distortion in delay loops
debug:	The ATmega328 when programmed using Arduino IDE had the following -
		Board = Arduino UNO
		Programmer = USBasp
	Thus the 'boards.txt' file shall have the configuration of 5V and 16MHz
	Device uses the following -
		Voltage = 3.3V
		Crystal = external, 8MHz
	Thus, a wise choice was to select the following in Arduino IDE
		Board = Pro Mini (3.3V, 8MHz) w/ ATmega328
		Programmer = USBasp

Issue:	Arduino generates a warning regarding SCK period when programming.
debug:	Upload the firmware on USBasp.
