-1-
- Preparing the PCB -

Basic resource = PCB
	Visually check the PCB for shorted traces.
	Use OHP to mark the jumper holes - in case of NPTH boards, double sided boards
	Apply flux over the board if there is no solder masking layer on the board.

-2-
- Jumper Wires -

Solder jumper PTH leads into the jumper holes (marked previously).
	Level the board on both sides.
	Test continuity on both sides of PCB for every track with a jumper.
		Special attention to be paid to Vcc and GND loops.

-3-
- Passive components -

Mount the passive devices like, Resistors, Inductors and Capacitors of both sides.
	Size is 0603 SMD package.

Test the LED. Switch the DMM to continuity mode. Apply the DMM terminals to the LED.
	Mount LED and diode packages below or equal to the 0805 packages.

Solder the transistors SOT/ SOP/ SOIC packages.

-4-
- SMD IC packages -	<TO BE MADE MORE COHERENT>

Solder controller or such TQFP, QFP packages
Solder TQFN, DFN, QFN packages - they are taller than QFP family of packages.

-5-
- Through Hole components -	<TO BE MADE MORE COHERENT>

burg, esp etc.

-A-
- Programming -

Method:
	Plug in the USBasp and read the IC.
If-Success:
	Erase it completely
Errors possible: {contain message synopsis NOT verbatim}
	Check connections =
		Vcc or GND between main board and programmer not routed properly
	Device signature does not match =
		Check if board selected is right
	Cannot access /dev/ttyACMx or COMn =
		Delete the var/.../LOCK/ttyACMx file. OR run the IDE from command prompt/ terminal
	USBasp not found =
		Check on some other port.
		Check drivers - for Windows
		A previous occurrence in Linux required an update wrt avr-dude
[Warning] SCK period =
		Upgrade USBasp firmware

-B-
- Testing basic components -

Method:
	Refer list on input and output pins
	Set pinMode() accordingly in set-up function
	#1	Glow single channel = monochromatic LED (possiblily red on-board LED)
If-Success:
	Blink the LED with a delay of 1000 ms
	Check the LED blinking interval
Errors possible: {contain message synopsis NOT verbatim}
	Delay may seem amplified.
		Check your perception of time! :P
		Check the board settings and fuse bits in "board.txt" file.
		Go through "preferences.txt" file for managing further time intervals.
		Ensure that the board selected is 'Pro Mini 3.3V/ 8Mhz w/ ATmega328'.

Method:
	#2	Set Button as input; toggle LED on button press
If-Success:
	Set the STAT pin as input for further testing.	
Errors possible: {contain message synopsis NOT verbatim}
	Check continuity of the switch.

-C-
- Battery Management -

Method:
	Plug in the microUSB cable. Remove the current-measurement jumper (not present in circularBoard and further PCB iterations)
	In case of the current-measurement jumper - attach DMM terminal on 200mA current mode
	Program Vusb-in pin as input
	Monitor 
If-Success:
	Let the battery charge to its full capacity.
	Measure the time required for complete charging.
Errors possible: {contain message synopsis NOT verbatim}
	Battery does not charge:
		Check the ground loops.
		Check prog resistance to be between 2k to 1k.
