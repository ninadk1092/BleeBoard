Programmer:	ArduinoISP
Board:		Arduino Uno
IDE/ Tool:	Arduino-1.6.5

--- Conditions: 5V 16MHz ---

Issue: Burning Bootloader.
The bootloader cannot be burned in the same configuration.
If programmer == AVR ISP
stk500 sync error reported (10 trials)

Suggested:


Debug:	Take a clean ATmega and burn bootloader
	Take a clean ATmega and burn code

Proceed:	Use ESP to transfer code

Observations:	Code gets uploaded with bootloader already present.

In Case we want to install a bootloader we need to use SPI
