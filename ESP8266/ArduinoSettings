- Arduino IDE 1.6.5 -

The Ubuntu software centre provides Arduino IDE version < 1.6 (1.1.0 actually).
The ESP8266 generic boards - namely, the ESP-01, ESP-05 etc are supported by Arduino IDE 1.6.3 and above.

- Download Arduino IDE 1.6.5 -

Link:		https://www.arduino.cc/en/Main/Software
Issues:		The Linux 64 bit version is a tar.xz file with a erroneous checksum(1).
Solution:	Download the tar.xz file and execute the following instructions in the terminal:

---


- Install Arduino -

Open the terminal <Ctrl + Alt + T>
cd ~/Downloads
tar -xvf arduino-1.6.5-linux64.tar.xz
sudo mv arduino-1.6.5 /opt

check the JAVA environment - Arduino uses the JAVA RXTX for loading the code and for the serial monitor.
[
	This results in var/LOCK...ttyACM0 files not getting deleted.
	In 1.6.5, this has been overcome as Arduino does not use RXTX - one more advantage for using IDE > 1.6.3	
]
sudo apt-get install openjdk-7-jre
{if it already exists, the terminal prints "0 upgraded, 0 newly installed, 0 to remove and 0 not upgraded.", else it'll be downloaded}

Now plug in the Arduino Uno board and run the following:
sudo chmod a+rw /dev/ttyX
	The X is usually ACM0 = /dev/ttyACM0
However it is always better to check this.
Steps to check:
Do not plug the arduino
run 'ls /dev/'
plug the arduino
run 'ls /dev/'
check which device has newly appeared - that is ofCourse the Arduino :P

The Arduino has been successfully installed - however - it wont start by simply typing 'arduino' into the terminal.
This is because the ppa repository only recognises the old arduino (ide-1.1.0) as 'the' arduino IDE.
So we need to run '/opt/arduino-1.6.5/arduino'. <we could store this path in a variable and thus make it a single command - but whatever!>
Instead we make a shortcut! >
cd ~/Desktop
ln -s /opt/arduino-1.6.5/arduino

Open ‘Files’ program from the launcher
Go to menu ‘Edit’, ‘Preferences’, tab ‘Behavior’ and set ‘Executable Text Files’ to ‘Ask each time’.
This will ensure that instead of opening it in gedit, it actually runs the script! - its boring to click run with no 'remember my choice option' so I prefer the path variable - but then again whatever!

- Configure for ESP modules -

Open ArduinoIDE
File > Preferences (Ctrl + ,)
In the space for "Additional Boards Manager URLs" add:
'http://arduino.esp8266.com/package_esp8266com_index.json'
We can add multiple links like this: <link1>,<link2>,<link3>...

Tools > Board Manager
Select the last option 'esp8266 by ESP8266 Community' > install (approx 130MB)

The Arduino is all set to run the Lua and talk directly to ESP8266!! :)
