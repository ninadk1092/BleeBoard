This folder is basically for updates in work to implement ESP8266 as the sole controller. If not so, at least use its modes through Lua.

Reading Order:

1) ArduinoSettings
2) ESPFirmware
3) Better Idea would be to surf the links in References (But we can jump directly to (4))
4) LuaTrials
5) SidetrackingATmega328
